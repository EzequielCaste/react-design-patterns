# React Design Patterns

Design patterns are effective solutions to common application development challenges.

## Common Challenges

- Creating reusable layouts
- Reusing complex logic between multiple components
(if we have two or more components that need to do the same complex things such as load data from a server how do we best represent that in our react apps so that we can share that code between those components instead of having to copy and paste it)
- Working with forms
- Incorporating functional programming concepts into our code

### Layout Components
- Split-screen
- Items and Lists
- Modal components

### Container Components
- CurrentUserLoader component
- UserLoader component
- ResourceLoader component
- DataSource component
- Loading data from localStorage

### Controlled and Uncontrolled Components
- Uncontrolled forms
- Controlled forms
- Controlled modals
- Uncontrolled onboarding flows
- Controlled onboarding flows
